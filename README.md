# Image_Editing
In this image editing project using C# libraries, it is possible to read and write an image from a .bmp format. The image is saved in an output file different from the one given as input (always Bitmap format).

The project presents a multiple-choice menu for making changes to the input image:
* Image information.
* Black and White.
* Grey Shade.
* Mirror effect.
* Shrink.
* Enlargement.
* Rotate 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
* Rotate to any angle.
* Edge detection.
* Blur.
* Edge enhancement.
* Pushing.
* Mandelbrot fractal (does not use the input image).
* Histogram.
* Image encoding.
* Decoding a hidden image.
* Color explosion (Innovation).

The project also proposes a QR code generator.
