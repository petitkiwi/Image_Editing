# Image_Editing
In this image editing project using C# libraries, it is possible to read and write an image from a .bmp format. The image is saved in an output file different from the one given as input (always Bitmap format).

The project presents a multiple-choice menu for making changes to the input image:
1 - Image information.
2 - Black and White.
3 - Grey Shade.
4 - Mirror effect.
5 - Shrink.
6 - Enlargement.
7 - Rotate 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
8 - Rotate to any angle.
9 - Edge detection.
10 - Blur.
11 - Edge enhancement.
12 - Pushing.
13 - Mandelbrot fractal (does not use the input image).
14 - Histogram.
15 - Image encoding.
16 - Decoding a hidden image.
17 - Color explosion (Innovation).

The project also proposes a QR code generator.
